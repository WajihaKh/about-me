        <p> "Bella enjoys her space but when she is feeling a bit needy she will not hesitate to ask for pets and treats. 
            She is an extroverted cat, loves being outdoor every chance she gets. Unfortunately she does bring alive 
            and dead presents. Most importantly, she loves eating as much as possible, whether that's bugs/mice, her cat food,
            grass or dairy products." </p>
        <p> "Rosie, an angelic, kind, loving old lady. She will always ask for attention, always demand for pets and will take
            you to the bathroom to climb onto the sink so that she can sip on some water. Even tho she enjoys the outdoors,
            she gets very frighten by sound. Food is her main source of energy, she always looks around to steal either Bellas
            food, sits by her bowl or she will make people follow her to her bowl." </p>
